Make your own step-by-step guide
================================

This template allows you to build a more advanced step-by-step guide.
The example theme here is for you to change as much as you like to
create appearance and content which are truly your own.

READ THROUGH THE COMMENTS. This is a comment. Everything inside of
this for HTML or '/*' for CSS, is not processed as code, but
instead are just text comments about the code. For this project, the
comments will give you instructions, hints and guides to completing
the project, so skim down through the comments to get an understanding
of what you are being asked to do.

GET ORIENTED IN THE CODE. HTML is made up of tags that look like
this <p> </p>. The tags tell you something about the information
contained between them. Click on the tags in the code on this side
of the editor to get a description of what each tag is for.

IN THIS CHALLENGE, YOU WILL LEARN ABOUT:

- HTML: Nested lists
- HTML: Unordered list
- HTML: Captions
- CSS: Borders
- CSS: Embedding images and videos

              <h3>Get an undergraduate degree in journalism.</h3>
              <p>While a degree in journalism is not required in order to become a successful journalist, pursuing journalism as an undergraduate degree can make your entry into the journalism profession easier. Some journalists can be successful without having earned a degree in journalism; though this is the case, having such a degree may facilitate a successful career. 
Consider doing a double major in journalism and another field if your university offers such a double major. Consider choosing something “wildly different” from journalism in order to diversify yourself. For aspiring legal journalists, the most appropriate second major would be a law-related field.</p>

              <h3>Attend law school.</h3>
              <p> Consider going to law school if you want to be a legal journalist. Again, you do not need a law degree to become a legal journalist but having one can certainly help. Journalism requires coming up with new ideas, synthesizing existing ideas, and communicating those ideas effectively verbally and in writing. A degree in law can be excellent preparation for acquiring those skills. Importantly, if your goal is to be a legal journalist, then having specialist legal knowledge acquired in law school can help you immensely. Some U.S. law schools offer joint degree programs in journalism with their law degree. UC Berkeley, for example, offers a masters degree in journalism as a joint degree along with its law degree. Check if your law school offers a joint degree with the journalism school at your university.</p>

              <h3>Attend graduate school.</h3>
              <p>You may not have a background in either law or journalism and do not wish to attend law school. If so, consider doing a master’s degree in journalism or legal studies (or both). These are not required to become a legal journalist but can help you in much the same way that a law degree or an undergraduate journalism degree can in becoming a legal journalist.</p>

              <h3>Enroll in a continuing education or certificate program. </h3>
              <p>If you are at a stage in your career where attending school full-time is not an option, you may consider the option of taking a continuing education course in law or journalism (or both) on a part-time basis or enrolling in a certificate program or other non-degree program. Although these are not required in order to become a legal journalist, they offer a cost-effective and accelerated route to acquiring the education that can help you become a legal journalist.
Loyola Law School, for example, offers a three-day fellowship known as “Journalist Law School” to enable journalists with at least three years of journalism experience to learn about reporting on legal matters without a law degree. At the end of the fellowship, fellows receive a certificate of completion.</p>

              <h3>Start off with an internship.</h3>
              <p>While you can certainly make a mid-career switch to journalism, starting early would be a better idea because “the earlier you start and succeed, the higher you’re likely to rise.” For an aspiring legal journalist, this means getting an internship that offers legal journalism experience early on in your career if possible. Getting an internship is also a good way to build a portfolio, meet people in the field, and make contacts, all of which could prove significant for finding permanent employment.</p>

This should also help you stay abreast with current legal events, which should in turn help you contribute to the debate surrounding the particular issue you are reading about if you are currently working as a journalist or writing a legal blog.</p>

              <p>In recent years, blogging has become a method of disseminating one’s ideas online to a wide audience in a quick and cost-efficient manner. Blogging may not be regarded as the same as journalism by some commentators, but blogging is also regarded by others as a useful training ground for journalists, and some commentators do not regard the differences between the two as significant. Begin writing a blog on legal matters, and your ideas may reach a wide audience fairly easily and efficiently. Make sure the content of your blog is professional and thoroughly researched so that you make an impact on your audience through the quality of your work.</p>
